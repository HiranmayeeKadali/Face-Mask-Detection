# Face Mask Detection
This repository contains a face mask detection project implemented in Python using OpenCV and Keras. The project aims to detect whether a person is wearing a face mask or not from images. The project aims to detect whether individuals in a live video feed are wearing masks or not. 

# Key Features
Real-time Detection: Utilizes OpenCV to process live video feed from a webcam and detect faces in real-time.
CNN Model: Trained a CNN model using Keras to classify face regions into "MASK" or "NO MASK" categories.
Haar Cascade Classifier: Employs Haar Cascade classifier for face detection in the video stream.
Visualization: Visualizes detection results by outlining detected faces with rectangles and overlaying labels indicating mask presence.
